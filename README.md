# redesign-nj-covid

The New Jersey COVID Alert app is a digital hub that allows New Jersey residents to find information on the COVID-19 virus, sign up for the vaccine waitlist, and record symptoms. 


This is a redesign concept project that does not include logic or code. It is a case study that reflects findings based on user interviews and behavior observances. There are three use cases outlined in this study, each of which improve a current process in the COVID Alert app. The GUI was also redesigned to give a more modern and friendly look (the original version looked like the space jam website).

This is a personal concept project that is not related or reflective of the NJ DOH.
